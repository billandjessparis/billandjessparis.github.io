<h1>Bon Appétit!</h1>

<p>
    We had a blast eating our way through Paris. We ate plenty of pastries, but we also tried new charcuterie meats, escargot, and more. Here are a few of our tips on different
    aspects of dining in France:
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Water</strong> - Listen to Rick Steves and learn the phrase “un carafe d'eau, s'il vous plaît” (a carafe of still water).
    The bottled water prices are expensive, and we forgot until we got the first bill!
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Pastries</strong> - Think beyond croissants and baguettes, and try some things you can't get back home!
    We found out about pastries like the Paris-Brest, Mont Blanc, etc. from the YouTube channel
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@LesFrenchiesTravel">Les Frenchies</a>. We made a point of touring some of their
    recommended bakeries and trying new-to-us pastries.

<p>
    <strong>Try New Things</strong> - Don’t be afraid to try unusual food, especially regional specialties. Bill ordered escargot at one of our dinners and loved it!
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Picnics</strong> - When the weather was nice, we followed Rick Steve’s advice to have a picnic! It was quick
    and easy to grab ham-and-butter sandwiches and enjoy them on a bench in a park. It's inexpensive, too!
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Ask for Suggestions</strong> - Before we left, we asked our French teacher what she would recommend trying in France, and she told us
    we couldn't visit Paris without trying a crêpe Suzette, a flambéed crêpe made for you at your table!

<p>
    <strong>Seasonal Specialties</strong> - We were in Paris in early April and had the pleasure of seeing and trying the exquisite Easter chocolate. Look for seasonal foods, you never know if you’ll be able to try them again!

<p>
    <strong>Fine Dining</strong> - Don't be intimidated by a restaurant just because it has a Michelin sign outside! Paris is the best place to go all-out. We were a bit intimidated to try fine
    dining restaurants in Paris, but we went anyway! We had a great experience and great service - and great food, of course! So many restaurants in France have Michelin stars that
    you might accidentally eat in one and find out later, like we did with Le Train Bleu!
