<h1>Let us tell you about our trip!</h1>
<div class="translation">"Bienvenue!"</div>

<div>
    <p>
        We're Jess and Bill and this our Rick Steves tour scrapbook! In April 2022, we took the
        seven-day <a href="https://www.ricksteves.com/tours/france/paris"><strong>Rick Steves' Best of Paris</strong></a> tour.
        These pages and photos tell the story of our Parisian adventure, as well as a few side trips we took on our own. This was our first trip to continental Europe and we learned a lot on
        the tour! We included a ton of <strong>travel tips</strong>, so you can relax and have as much fun as we did. Browse through each individual day of the trip using the menu above.
        Below you can find a map of our trip, some more about
        who we are, and a few highlights.

        Bonjour! I’m <strong>Jess</strong>, a novice traveller who loves art museums, fashion, gardening, dessert, and city life.
        I wanted to go to Paris because it’s home to some of the best examples of my favorite things. I love trying
        new things and I enjoyed all the history and knowledge I gained from our wonderful tour guide, Marie.

        Bonjour! I’m <strong>Bill</strong>, I love traveling with my wife Jess and couldn’t wait to finally go to Europe after spending
        so long at home in 2020. I enjoy learning about history, architecture, and art. I spent some time
        studying French during the pandemic, and was looking forward to a chance to try it out in the real world.

<h1>Six Reasons We Love Traveling With Rick Steves</h1>
<div class="translation">&ldquo;Six Raisons pour voyager avec Rick Steves&rdquo;</div>
<blockquote class="quote-holder">

        &ldquo;We learned a lot on the tour! We included a ton of tips, so you can relax and have as much fun as we did.&rdquo;
    </div>
</blockquote>
<p>
    We chose Rick Steves because we love how easy and relaxed it is, and because
    we had so many authentic, cultural experiences the last time we took a Rick Steves trip. This is
    consistent across both Rick Steve’s tours we have taken. Back in 2017, we went on the best trip we've ever
    taken, traveling around the UK on Rick Steves' <a href="https://www.ricksteves.com/tours/england/best-england-tour">Best of England &  Wales tour</a>.
    We had an amazing time, exploring cozy villages, and
    enjoying the beautiful city of Bath.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>1. You’re Always With Friends</strong><br>
    Everyone in the group gets to know each other, new friendships form, and there’s always someone who is up for a meal!
    The guides make an effort to get to know people on the tour, and are always fun and knowledgeable!
</p>

<p>
    <strong>2. You Skip The Lines</strong><br>
    All your museum tickets are booked in advance and you enter with a guide so there’s no waiting
    in the long queues that are often part of popular destinations.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>3. Transportation Is Covered</strong><br>
    The group often takes the bus or train together so you don’t need to worry about how to
    get around. Although Marie also taught us how to use the train on our own so we could navigate successfully on our
    free time and future trips.

</div>

<p>
    <strong>4. Locals Shared Tips and Culture</strong> <br>
    Our tour guide and museum guides were all locals so we got insider tips on what
    foods to try, what times to go to popular attractions, the history of the neighborhoods, etc.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>5. You Try New Things</strong> <br>
    Rick Steve’s encourages “no grumps” so everyone has the attitude of being open minded. This
    helps the group get a lot of done in a day and we all got to try lots of new foods and experiences.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>6. Each Trip is Unique</strong><br>
    Each tour is different based on the season, events, availability, etc. The guides always have a
    plan B and C! It didn’t happen often but occasionally weather or unexpected closures change the plan, but we always
    did something interesting.

<h1>Our Hotel</h1>
<div class="translation">"Notre Hôtel"</div>

<div>
    <p>
        Every tour is different, but on ours, we stayed at <strong>Hotel Londres Eiffel</strong>, a stylish boutique hotel in
        the 7th Arrondissement (district) of Paris,
        just blocks from the <strong>Eiffel Tower</strong> and <strong>Rue Cler</strong>, a beautiful shopping street full of tasty food and flowers.
        The staff were super helpful: Arnaud at the front desk recommended restaurants and helped us book taxis.
        The tour group hung out in the breakfast room every morning and even enjoyed drinks together in the lobby
        lounge one evening. We also had the pleasure of a rare visit from Samba, the hotel owner’s Golden
        Retriever (seen above!).
