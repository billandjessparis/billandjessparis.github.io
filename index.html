<div class="translation">Let us tell you about our trip!</div>

<div>
    <p>
        We're Jess and Bill and this our Rick Steves tour scrapbook! In April 2022, we took the
        seven-day <a href="https://www.ricksteves.com/tours/france/paris"><strong>Rick Steves' Best of Paris</strong></a> tour.
        These pages and photos tell the story of our Parisian adventure, as well as a few side trips we took on our own. This was our first trip to continental Europe and we learned a lot on
        the tour! We included a ton of <strong>travel tips</strong>, so you can relax and have as much fun as we did. Browse through each individual day of the trip using the menu above.
        Below you can find a map of our trip, some more about
        who we are, and a few highlights.

        We'd been planning our first trip to France in early 2020, but the COVID-19 pandemic had put those plans on hold. When
        Rick Steves announced that they were starting tours again for 2022, we were really excited, and
        decided it was time to make our travel dreams a reality.
        We chose Rick Steves because back in 2017, we went on the best trip we've ever taken, traveling around the UK on Rick Steves'
        <a href="https://www.ricksteves.com/tours/england/best-england-tour">Best of England &  Wales tour</a>.
        We had an amazing time, exploring cozy villages, and enjoying the beautiful city of Bath.

        Bonjour! I’m <strong>Jess</strong>, a novice traveller who loves art museums, fashion, gardening, dessert, and city life.
        I wanted to go to Paris because it’s home to some of the best examples of my favorite things. I love trying
        new things and I enjoyed all the history and knowledge I gained from our wonderful tour guide, Marie.

        Bonjour! I’m <strong>Bill</strong>, I love traveling with my wife Jess and couldn’t wait to finally go to Europe after spending
        so long at home in 2020. I enjoy learning about history, architecture, and art. I spent some time
        studying French during the pandemic, and was looking forward to a chance to try it out in the real world.

<h1>Notre Hôtel</h1>
<div class="translation">"Our Hotel"</div>

<div>
    <p>
        We stayed at <strong>Hotel Londres Eiffel</strong>, a stylish boutique hotel in the 7th Arrondissement (district) of Paris,
        just blocks from the <strong>Eiffel Tower</strong> and <strong>Rue Cler</strong>, a beautiful shopping street full of tasty food and flowers.
        The staff were super helpful: Arnaud at the front desk recommended restaurants and helped us book taxis.
        The tour group hung out in the breakfast room every morning and even enjoyed drinks together in the lobby
        lounge one evening. We also had the pleasure of a rare visit from Samba, the hotel owner’s Golden
        Retriever (seen above!).
