<h1>Heading to Versailles</h1>

<p>
    We were both looking forward to this part of the tour: Versailles Day! We woke up early, so we took
    a morning walk around our neighborhood. We strolled through the market street Rue Cler and watched the vendors
    set up their stands before grabbing some breakfast pastries. It was a very relaxing way to start the day.
</p>

<p>
    The trip to Versailles isn't very long. Marie took us to a nearby RER train station and we boarded the train to
    Versailles. A little less than an hour later, we had arrived in the town of Versailles.
</p>

<p>
    The palace and gardens are enormous, and the distances inside Versailles are vast: just walking from the gate to
    the main entrance is a hike. It was a windy day, so we were happy to get indoors, where we walked through
    the famous <strong>Hall of Mirrors</strong>, and saw the <strong>Queen's Bedchambers</strong>, which had only re-opened days
    earlier after
    years of renovation. We also saw the desk where the Treaty of Versailles was signed, which ended World War I.

<h1>The Gardens</h1>

<p>
    After we'd finished exploring the main palace, we got ready to explore the gardens. Suddenly, the windy weather
    turned into a full rainstorm. Most of the tour group decided to head back to Paris, but a few of us attempted to
    wait out the storm in the Versailles cafeteria, with lunch and glasses of wine. We were glad we did! About an
    hour later, the clouds miraculously rolled away and a beautiful day awaited us. A lot of visitors had given up
    because of the storm, which left us the rare opportunity to view the gardens with minimal crowds.

    Marie had told us the grounds can take a long time to explore just because of their size, and had mentioned that you
    can either take a free tram or rent a golf cart. We opted for the golf cart, which was a great decision: we were able
    to head directly to our target sites and we covered almost
    the whole grounds that day, including the dozens of side gardens, sculptures and fountains.

<h1>Grand Trianon, Petit Trianon, Marie-Antoinette's Hamlet</h1>

<p>

    Way out in the corner of the estate, we visited the <strong>Grand Trianon</strong> and
    <strong>Petit Trianon</strong> palaces. These were enormous
    buildings in their own right, but they were side palaces to the main Versailles palace. We found a nice garden shop
    way out in the grounds and bought some books. We ran into other tour members out there and chatted. Finally,
    we headed to Marie-Antoinette's hamlet. It was partially under construction, but it was still fascinating to see.
</p>

<p>
    We brought the golf cart back and caught the train to Paris, where we ate a really nice dinner at a
    <strong><a href="https://www.leptittroquet.fr/en/">P'tit Troquet</a></strong>, a cozy restaurant
    that Marie had recommended to us.
