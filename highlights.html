<h1>Versailles</h1>
<p>
    Because of the brief thunderstorm, a lot of visitors left Versailles early,
    giving us the time to view the gardens with few crowds. We even made it to Marie-Antoinette's hamlet, which
    was virtually empty, and all the way in the farthest corner of the estate. We felt really lucky to be able to
    see it. You can see one of the buildings in the top left of the header photo above. We also got to see the
    desk where the Treaty of Versailles was signed, which ended World War I.

<h1>Sculpture</h1>
<p>
    In many of the museums we visited, including the Louvre and the Rodin Museum,
    there were so many outstanding sculptures, with higher quality than anything we'd seen before - in the US
    or on our other travels. You can even see a "veiled" marble statue in the photo at the top of the page,
    which we saw at the Louvre. Even apartment buildings had fine sculptures on their exteriors - see
    the center photo above.

<h1>The Eiffel Tower</h1>
<p>
    The Eiffel Tower looked amazing at night, and every hour a sparkling
    light show would take place on the tower. Because it's so much taller than the rest of Paris, we saw
    the light show from so many different places, and it never got old. On our Rick Steves cruise on the Seine,
    we passed right below the Eiffel Tower, fully illuminated.

<h1>Place des Vosges</h1>
<p>
    This was a city square, completely enclosed by elegant apartment buildings all built in
    the same style, with a landscaped square in the middle.
