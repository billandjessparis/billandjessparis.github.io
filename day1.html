<h1><span class="page-title">Day 1:</span> Sights Within Walking Distance</h1>

<p>
    The tour would meet up in mid-afternoon, so we decided to use the morning to sightsee on our own. We crossed the
    river to the <strong>Arc de Triomphe</strong>, where we learned about the <em>axe historique</em>, an amazing urban plan that aligned the
    Grande Arche in La Défense, the Arc de Triomphe and the front of the Louvre. Standing by the Arc de Triomphe,
    you could look in either direction and clearly see those two other landmarks!
</p>

<p>
    Walking a little further, we ended up at the <strong>Grand Palais</strong> and <strong>Petit Palais</strong>, two ornate
    buildings that were
    constructed for an expo around the turn of the twentieth century. Our French teacher back home had recommended
    the Petit Palais, which was a beautiful museum with sculptures and paintings inside. It surrounds a central
    courtyard with a gorgeous garden. It was one of our favorite museums in Paris.
</p>

<p>
    Next, we walked the length of the <strong>Champs Elysées</strong> before heading to the botanical garden on the metro.

<h1>Transportation</h1>
<p>

    This day we took the Paris Metro station for the first time. We had a rough idea how to get to our destination,
    the Jardin des Plantes, from the maps app on our phone, but we still had a little trouble buying individual tickets.
    We asked the station agent, who was very patient and helpful - he even printed out the list of stops we'd be
    taking. We thanked him and headed out.
</p>

<h1>Trying Out Our French Skills</h1>
<p>
    We got out at our stop, and coincidentally walked right into a <strong>Sunday flea market</strong>! Most of the
    vendors spoke only French - this was the first time on our trip that we couldn't count on being able to speak
    English at all, but it was fine! We did our first haggling in a foreign language, and negotiated to buy a
    five-euro postcard for a (still pretty steep!) two euros. We were just excited to communicate!
</p>

<h1>Picnic at Jardin des Plantes</h1>

        Next, we were headed to <strong>Jardin des Plantes</strong>, a giant botanical garden that used to be the king's medicinal garden hundreds of years ago.
        On our way to the garden, we were getting hungry, so we took the Rick Steves approach and decided to have a
        picnic for lunch. We went into a café and bought two ham-and-butter sandwiches, a Paris-Brest pastry and some
        drinks. We took them to-go and got back on our route to the garden, where we enjoyed our picnic and the gorgeous
        setting. Having a picnic saved time - and was very affordable!

<h1>Meeting the Group and Our Tour Guide</h1>
<p>
    <img class="inline-image" src="images/marie2.jpeg" style="width: 250px">
    In the afternoon we met our tour guide, Marie, and the other guests in the lobby. We got set up with our weekly metro passes (these were so much easier than buying individual tickets!), found our group buddies, and Marie gave us an overview of what we were going to do on the trip.
</p>

<p>
    Next, we all took a quick tour of the neighborhood. Marie pointed out notable bakeries, a grocery store, the metro stops, how
    to get to the <strong>Eiffel Tower</strong>, <strong>Rue Cler</strong>, and a couple of good restaurant options for our
    free nights. Then she took us all to a group dinner at the restaurant <strong>La Terrasse</strong>. We had a private room
    on the second floor and a great view of the École Miltaire, France's officer's training school. We had a
    great time chatting with everyone and even learned that one of the tour group members is a customer of the
    software company we started. It was fun to have a personal connection like that!

<h1>Evening Bus Tour</h1>
<p>
    After dinner, we met our bus driver, Vincent, who took us on an evening bus tour of Paris. We saw so many sights for
    the very first time: <strong>Notre Dame</strong> on the Île de la Cité (literally, "City Island"), the military
    memorial <strong>Les Invalides</strong>, the Arc de Triomphe at night, and the <strong>Louvre</strong> exterior at night.
</p>

<p>
    Vincent brought us back to the hotel for the night. We couldn't believe all the things we'd done in only a day and a half in Paris!
