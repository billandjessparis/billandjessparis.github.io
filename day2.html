    On day two with the group, we walked around central Paris, including <strong>Île de la Cité</strong> and
    <strong>Luxembourg Gardens</strong>. We took our
    first metro trip with the group, which went smoothly despite being the first public transit trip for many in the group.
    We traveled from École Militaire to Pont Neuf. We visited the stunning <strong>Saint Chapelle</strong>, a
    royal chapel whose walls are virtually entirely glass, creating a jewel box of tinted glass.

    Next, we toured Île de la Cité and the area around Notre Dame area. Unfortunately, we could only see Notre Dame from the
    exterior because it was still being repaired after the tragic fire in 2019. It was still incredible to see the flying
    buttresses on the exterior.

    Marie then spoke to the group about the city's literary culture and we stopped by <strong>Shakespeare & Co</strong>, the legendary
    English-language bookstore, and passed by the street book vendors known as Les Bookinistes. We also caught our first glimpse of the intricate
    Art Nouveau metro station entrances.
</p>

<p>
    We took a break for lunch on the island <strong>Île Sainte Louis</strong>. We had lunch on our own at the traditional bistro
    <strong>Le Flore en l'Ile</strong>,
    where we capped our meal with a cone of Berthillon's famous and delicious ice cream! Our hometown, Princeton, is also famous
    for ice cream, and it was fun to compare. We had another hometown connection on Île Sainte Louis - our neighbor back home
    had recommended the colorful and trendy clothing boutique "78isl." After our meal, we stopped by, did a little shopping,
    and had a lovely conversation with the owner. She even wrote us a note thanking our neighbor for the referral.

    After lunch, we all walked through the <strong>Latin Quarter</strong> and learned about the history of the Sorbonne,
    the University of Paris. We ended the group
    tour for the day at <strong>Luxembourg Gardens</strong>. The group strolled the park and admired the statues of queens and the
    <strong>Medici Fountain</strong>. Jess marveled at the living ivy gardland that lined the path up to the fountain.

<p>
    For dinner, the two of us had a reservation at <strong>Café Marly</strong>, a beautiful restaurant tucked into the colonnade of the
    Louvre courtyard. It was <em>so</em> tucked away, that we couldn't find it and had to stop in a nearby hotel lobby to ask
    the receptionist for directions. The restaurant was beautiful, and our waiter told us that it was named after the
    marble Marly horses commissioned by Louis XV, which are now in the sculpture courtyard of the Louvre.

    Although the dinner was great, I forgot a Rick Steves tip at the end: the waiter asked me what percentage tip I'd
    like to leave. I left 20%, a standard tip in the US. But I kicked myself afterwards - I remembered afterward that
    Rick Steves and many of our tour guides had told us that percentage tipping at restaurants is not common in France. Usually, you
    leave a euro or two for good service, but waiters don't expect the large tips customary in America. Lesson learned!
</p>


<p>
    We ended the night by walking up to the <strong>Paris Opera</strong>, which we had seen from afar on the evening bus tour the night
    before. It was even more spectacular up close and the perfect way to end the day.
