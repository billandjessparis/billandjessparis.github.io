<h1>Before the Tour</h1>
<div class="translation">"Avant La Visite"</div>

<p>
    We arrived at Charles de Gaulle Airport in the early morning and met the taxi driver the hotel sent to meet us
    at the airport. As we approached Paris on the
    highway, we were amazed to see the Eiffel Tower rising high above the city, visible from miles away. Our driver, José,
    pointed out various landmarks as we drove into the city itself. We passed the
    Trocadero (a plaza looking across the Seine at the Eiffel Tower), and drove us down the Champs Elysées and around the Arc
    de Triomphe, before dropping us off at our hotel.
</p>

<p>
    When we arrived, we should've been tired: it was 1AM or 2AM Eastern time. But we were too excited, so we
    dropped off our bags and headed out to sight-see. The hotel Rick Steves picked was in an amazing neighborhood with bakeries,
    restaurants and lots of beautiful buildings. Most importantly, it was right near
    the park that contains the Eiffel Tower, the Champs du Mars!  We didn't have any specific plans for this part of the day,
    so we decided to explore.

   We first stumbled on a restuarant called Cafe de Mars.
    There were two musicians playing live music, and a cute restaurant cat that wandered in and out whenever he got bored.
    The food was great, and the staff was fun. After a relaxing lunch and glass of wine, we walked down the market street
    <strong>Rue Cler</strong>,
    which Rick Steves highly recommends in his books and TV show. It's a pedestrian-only market street. You can get
    anything from Ladurée macarons, fancy Alain Ducasse chocolates, fresh produce,
    flowers, and more. A lot of the shop windows had Easter decorations and Easter candies available.
</p>

<p>
    With plenty of time to spare, we walked across the Seine to the Trocadero plaza, where got our first
    unobstructed view of the Eiffel Tower! Next we headed to the fashion museum, <strong>the Paris Galliera</strong>,
    which is housed in a massive old Parisian mansion. Jess drooled over the dresses, and we shopped in its bookstore.
</p>

<p>
    Finally, we had a 7:30 reservation at the restaurant <strong>Monsieur Bleu</strong>, but we were hungry slightly earlier.
    We thought maybe the bar might be open, but the restaurant was completely closed until 7! We'd heard (correctly) that
    dinner in France is much later than in
    the US, but didn't believe it until we experienced it! With that life lesson out of the way, we headed to the
    <strong>Palais de Tokyo</strong> courtyard and stumbled on
    a party hosted by the champagne company Ruinart. Jess spotted a poster with the RSVP URL, so we RSVP'd on our phones
    and headed straight in.

<p>
    There were art exhibits inside, and it was packed with people. We sampled the champagne, ate canapés, and took
    part in a community art project, where you could draw anything you want on a wall (we drew a picture of our
    dog, of course). Some other guests were from the US and Canada, so we were able to chat for a bit in English.

    Finally, it was time for our dinner. We walked back across the courtyard to Monsieur Bleu. From inside, we had our
    first view of the Eiffel Tower lit up at night. It looked incredible! You see the Eiffel Tower in photos and on TV so
    often that it's almost a cliché, but when you see it in real life, it's a really enormous and magnificent structure.
</p>

<p>
    We tried escargot for the first time here (it was delicious!). Finally, we had to admit to ourselves that we were
    tired, and we headed back to the hotel to go to sleep and get ready for our first official day of the tour.
