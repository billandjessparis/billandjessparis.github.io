<h1>16 Travel Tips for Paris and France</h1>

<p>
    <strong>1. Say "Bonjour" when going into a store and "Au revoir" when leaving</strong><br>

    This is our #1 tip for having a good time in France. It's rude in France to go into a store and not say hi to the shopkeeper or staff.
    Always say a quick "Bonjour!" when you go into a store. It's nice to say "Au revoir!" when leaving too.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>2. Keep a travel diary</strong><br>

    We always bring a physical notebook with us on trips, and write quick notes as we go. It will help you appreciate
    and remember your trip years later (it could even help you make a scrapbook website about your trip!). Bill has a dedicated
    Moleskine travel notebook, but you can use anything. Try to jot down your notes and impressions of each day
    when you get back to your hotel room at night.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>3. Stay open-minded</strong><br>

    We often look up a few restaurants, shops, and museums for a neighborhood where we’ll have free time. However,
    we don’t necessarily stick to a rigid plan - we still wander and try things that we just stumble on. Planning is more like
    insurance that we’ll always have something interesting to do if we don’t come across anything right away.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>4. You can ask Metro station agents for directions</strong><br>

    If you need help in the Metro, tell the attendant where you're going and they'll tell you how to get there.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>5. Try to learn a little French before you go.</strong><br>

    You don't need to know a lot of French to visit Paris, but it might help make your trip more interesting.
    We have some <a href="phrasebook.html">useful phrases</a> here, but it's worth it to take a few lessons before you
    go. We took an hour or two of classes with a local French tutor, and she helped us practice our pronunciation,
    learn phrases that are helpful for travel - and even gave us advice about things to do in France, foods to
    eat, and more.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>6. Research foods to try using YouTube</strong><br>

    Before we left, we watched dozens of videos from the YouTube channel
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@LesFrenchiesTravel">Les Frenchies</a>. We learned about
    pastries and bakeries we would never have known about without their advice.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>7. Don't ignore Rick's advice to pack light!</strong><br>

    We figured since we were staying in one city the whole time, it would be okay to pack a little more than usual. But it turned out
    to be a pain anyway! We had six different bags, and storing them when we switched hotels and fitting them
    into our European-sized hotel room was not easy!

    <strong>8. Make a photo book</strong><br>

    When you get back, organize your photos from the trip and get a photo book printed from a website like Shutterfly.
    Each time you take a trip, you can add another travel book to your shelf!
</p>
<p>
    <strong>9. Service is included!</strong><br>

    Tipping for restaurant meals is not common in France. You can leave a euro or two extra for good service,
    but the percentage tipping system doesn't exist in France. However, we still got guilted into giving a percentage
    tip by a waiter who could tell we were American. Don't fall for it like we did it!
</p>
<p>
    <strong>10. Don't ask random people for directions</strong><br>

    Most of the people you see on the street are busy - going to work or school, or trying to grab lunch. If you
    need directions or have a question, it's better to ask station agents or hotel receptionists - or to see if
    you can find directions on your phone.

    <strong>11. Look up events at places you're going to</strong><br>

    Before you leave, see if there are any special events happening. We got tickets before we left the US for a fashion show
    at the Galeries Lafayette department store. We also ordered theater tickets in advance. Events can sell out,
    so you're better off getting the tickets well before you leave.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>12. Consider learning how to spell out your last name in French</strong><br>

    This isn't necessary (it's like an extra credit idea), but it came in handy once or twice to be able to pronounce our
    last name using the French letter sounds when speaking to station agents or restaurant hosts. For example, the letter "t" is
    pronounced "tay" in French. You can find a pronunciation chart
    <a href="https://www.berlitz.com/blog/learn-french-alphabet" target="_blank">here</a>! You don't need to learn the whole
    alphabet, just the letters in your last name.

<p>
    <strong>13. All times are in 24-hour (military) time</strong><br>
    We set our digital watches and phones to 24-hour time
    when we left, so we didn't need to constantly convert times in our heads.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>14. Bring a smartphone battery pack</strong><br>

    Bring an external battery pack for your phone, and keep it charged. This is especially helpful when you're on a
    long day trip and don't want to worry about losing access to maps if your phone dies.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>15. Carry a hard copy of your hotel address</strong><br>

    Just in case your phone battery dies and you need to show it to a taxi driver or metro attendant, it's always
    good to have this with you!
</p>
<p>
    <strong>16. Check the weather before you leave on your trip</strong><br>

    We saw there was some rain in the forecast for Paris before we left, so we packed waterproof shoes, umbrellas,
    and raincoats. It always pays to check for this kind of thing before you leave!
